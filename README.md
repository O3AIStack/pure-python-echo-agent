# pure-python-echo-agent
Pure Python Echo Agent is a lightweight, framework-free AI chatbot that uses the OpenAI Chat API to respond to user input in real time. Designed as a starting point for anyone interested in building AI agents with plain Python, this project includes a simple event loop, a system prompt, and real-time interaction via the terminal. Ideal for beginners, educators, and developers who want to understand LLM-based agents from the ground upâ€”without the overhead of LangChain or other libraries.
